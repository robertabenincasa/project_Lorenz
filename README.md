# Lorenz system

The Lorenz system is a nonlinear, non-periodic, three-dimensional and deterministic system of
ordinary differential equations. It was developed by Lorenz in 1963 as a simplified mathematical
model for atmospheric convection, studying the case of a two-dimensional fluid layer uniformly
warmed from below and cooled from above. In its canonical form it is written as:

$$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
    \dot x=\sigma (y-x) \\
    \dot y=rx-xz-y \\
    \dot z=xy-bz
    \end{cases}
\end{equation} 
$$

The equations describe the rate of change of three quantities with respect to time: x is proportional
to the intensity of convection, y to the horizontal temperature variation, i.e. the temperature
difference between the ascending and descending branches, and z is proportional to the distortion
of the average vertical profile of temperature from linearity. The parameters Ïƒ and b are related to
the type of fluid and its properties and to the geometry of the problem, respectively. Instead, the
parameter r, linked to the Rayleigh number, is a measure of the behaviour of the fluid and gives
information about the presence or not of convection.
